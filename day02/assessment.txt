JavaScript Challenge:1 Sum of Even Numbers 
Question: Write a JavaScript function that returns the sum of only the even numbers in an 
array. 
Example : 
Input: s = [1,2,3,4] 
Output: 6 
Steps: 
Step 1: Initialize a variable sum with 0. 
Step 2: Loop through each element in the array using a for loop. 
Step 3: Check if the current element is even using the modulus operator (%). 
If the number is even (i.e., num % 2 === 0), add it to sum. 
Step 4: After the loop ends, return the final sum.

JavaScript Challenge: 2  Move Zeros to End
Question:
Write a JavaScript function to move all 0s to the end of an array while keeping the order of non-zero elements unchanged.
Example:
Input:
[0, 1, 0, 3, 12]
Output:
[1, 3, 12, 0, 0]
Steps:
Create a new array or use in-place logic.
Use a pointer (e.g., index) to track the position for non-zero elements.
Loop through the array:
If the current element is not zero, place it at the index and increment index.
After placing all non-zeros, fill the remaining positions with zero.
Return or modify the original array.

JavaScript Challenge:3 Count Vowels
Question:
Write a JavaScript function that counts the number of vowels in a given string.
Vowels are: a, e, i, o, u (both uppercase and lowercase should be counted).

Example:
Input:
"javascript"

Output:
3

Explanation:
The vowels in "javascript" are: a, a, i → Total = 3

Steps:
Initialize a counter variable to 0.
Define a string or set of vowels for comparison.
Loop through each character of the string.
Check if the character is a vowel.
If yes, increment the counter.
After the loop, return the count.

JavaScript Challenge : 4 Sum of Digits in a String
Question:
Write a JavaScript function that returns the sum of all numeric digits found in a string. Ignore any alphabetic characters or symbols.

Example:
Input:
"java123Scr45t"

Output:
14

Explanation:
The sum of digits  in java123Scr45t is :1+2+3+4+5 → Total = 15

Explanation:
-----------
Step 1: Extract all digits from the string.
Step 2: Initialize a variable sum with 0.
Step 3: Loop through the list of digit characters using a for loop.
Step 4: Convert each digit character to a number using parseInt() or Number().
Step 5: Add each digit to the sum.
Step 6: After the loop ends, return the final sum.
